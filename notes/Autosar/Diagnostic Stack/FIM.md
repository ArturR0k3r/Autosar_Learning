- Poll for permission before execution
- During configuration, data structures are built up to deal with sensetivness of FID against certain events
- Summarized event (multiple diagnostic event treated as 1)
- Permission state of FID
- Inhibit relations in data structures
- 1 FID : n inhibitions : n masks
- Inhibition counter
