#### Configuration stuff
- *DemTypeOfDTCSupported* to specify DTC byte
- Function *Dem_GetDTCOfEvent* shall get DTC mapped to eventId in configuration
- **Surpressed DTC**. Not visible for tester, but can be proceeded by monitor. Suppressed automatically if event is not aviable. DTC that suppressed is treated as non-configured.
- Event can be marked as unaviable so it weren't need in removal of him from configuration,
- Operationg cycles defining for cycle dependent status info. Restart/Switch to next operation cycle serves as trigger for calculation. Also used in funcs like aging, debouncing.
- Dependent and normal op cycles.
