**ASPICE (Automotive Software Process Improvement Capability dEtermination)** is **an industry-standard guideline for evaluating software development processes**. Introduced in 2005, ASPICE helps automotive suppliers incorporate best practices to identify defects earlier in development and ensure that OEM requirements are met.![[Pasted image 20230612114520.png]]

ASPICE aims at the quality of workflow. It says what to deliver at every step of workflow. It also covers parts before engineering is started. Aspice covers something like **proccess requirments** for OEM, not the tech one![[Pasted image 20230612115209.png]]

What is an interface of software elements?

An interface is **a boundary across which two independent entities meet and interact or communicate with each other**. The characteristics of an interface depend on the view type of its element. If the element is a component, the interface represents a specific point of its potential interaction with its environment.

Five levels of ASPICE:

![[Pasted image 20230612140606.png]]

Level 0 - Incomplete process: At Level 0, the organization has not implemented any specific software development process. The requirements are not systematically defined, and there is no control over the development activities. The organization may lack awareness or understanding of process discipline.

Level 1 - Performed process: At Level 1, the organization starts establishing basic project management practices. The project's scope, objectives, and responsibilities are defined, and project planning and tracking activities are performed. However, the process is not yet standardized or consistently applied across projects.

Level 2 - Managed process: At Level 2, the organization establishes a managed process with defined objectives and requirements. Project planning, tracking, and control activities are consistently applied. Basic project management and quality assurance practices are established. There is an emphasis on managing risks and addressing customer requirements.

Level 3 - Defined process: At Level 3, the organization has a well-defined and documented software development process. The process includes standardized templates, guidelines, and work instructions. The organization focuses on process improvement and actively measures and analyzes process performance. Configuration management, quality assurance, and defect prevention techniques are implemented.

Level 4 - Quantitatively managed process: At Level 4, the organization's software development process is quantitatively managed. Process performance is measured using specific metrics, and process improvements are based on data analysis. The organization focuses on optimizing its processes, reducing variations, and continuously improving its software development capabilities.

Level 5 - Optimizing process: At Level 5, the organization's software development process is fully optimized and continuously improved. The organization actively identifies areas for improvement, collects and analyzes data, and implements process improvements based on industry best practices. The focus is on innovation, learning, and achieving excellence in software development processes.
