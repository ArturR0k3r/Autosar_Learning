SOTIF, which stands for Safety of the Intended Functionality, is a concept and standard that complements [[ISO-26262]] in the automotive industry. While [[ISO-26262]] focuses on functional safety, which addresses the risks caused by malfunctions or failures of systems, SOTIF specifically addresses the risks arising from the intended functionality of systems that operate as intended but may still pose safety hazards.

The primary goal of SOTIF is to ensure that a system's intended functionality is safe and does not lead to hazardous situations or accidents. It recognizes that even if a system operates correctly according to its design, there can still be situations where the intended functionality itself poses safety risks.

SOTIF addresses various factors that can contribute to safety hazards, such as limitations in perception, understanding, and response to uncertain or unexpected events, as well as external influences. It also considers factors like misuse, inadequate human-machine interaction, and unreasonable behavior of the system.

SOTIF is based on the principle of risk assessment and risk reduction. It involves identifying potential hazards arising from the intended functionality, assessing the associated risks, and implementing measures to reduce those risks. These measures can include system design changes, the introduction of additional safeguards, or providing warnings and instructions to users.

SOTIF provides guidance and recommendations for addressing these risks throughout the system's development and operational lifecycle. It emphasizes the need for comprehensive analysis, including scenario-based analysis, to identify and evaluate potential hazards and risks arising from the intended functionality.

SOTIF is recognized as an important aspect of ensuring overall safety in the automotive industry, along with functional safety ([[ISO-26262]]). While [[ISO-26262]] focuses on mitigating risks from system malfunctions or failures, SOTIF addresses risks arising from the system's intended functionality. Together, these standards provide a comprehensive approach to achieving safety in complex automotive systems.
