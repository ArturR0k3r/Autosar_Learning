ISO 26262 is an international standard for functional safety in the automotive industry. It provides guidelines and requirements for the development of safety-critical automotive systems, with a focus on electrical and electronic systems.

The primary objective of ISO 26262 is to minimize the risk of failures in electronic systems that could lead to accidents, injuries, or fatalities. It addresses the specific challenges posed by the complexity and interconnectedness of modern automotive systems, which rely heavily on software and electronic components.

ISO 26262 is based on the concept of the safety lifecycle, which consists of various phases and activities. Here are the key components of the standard:

1. Management of Functional Safety: This involves establishing a safety management system within the organization, including defining roles and responsibilities, safety policies, and procedures for safety planning, verification, and validation.
2. Risk Assessment and Risk Management: This phase involves identifying and analyzing potential hazards and their associated risks. It includes techniques such as hazard analysis and risk assessment, determining safety goals, and defining safety requirements.
3. Functional Safety Concept: In this phase, a safety concept is developed to address the identified risks. It includes defining the system architecture, safety mechanisms, and safety requirements allocation to different system components.
4. System Development: This phase covers the development of the safety-related system. It involves requirements engineering, architectural design, hardware and software development, and integration of the system components.
5. Production, Operation, Service, and Decommissioning: This phase focuses on activities related to the production, operation, and maintenance of the system. It includes processes for manufacturing, installation, commissioning, and servicing of the safety-related system.
6. Supporting Processes: ISO 26262 also addresses various supporting processes, such as configuration management, verification and validation, supplier management, and change management. These processes ensure the integrity and safety of the system throughout its lifecycle.


The standard defines four Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) – ASIL A, B, C, and D – to classify the safety requirements based on the severity of potential hazards. The higher the ASIL level, the more stringent the safety requirements.

ISO 26262 provides detailed guidance on verification and validation techniques, including testing, analysis, and simulation, to ensure that the safety requirements are met. It also emphasizes the importance of documentation, traceability, and metrics to demonstrate compliance with the standard.

It's worth noting that ISO 26262 is not a legally binding regulation but is widely recognized and adopted by automotive manufacturers and suppliers as a best practice for achieving functional safety in their products. Compliance with ISO 26262 is typically required by regulatory bodies and is considered essential for ensuring the safety of automotive systems.

ISO 26262 is divided into 12 main parts, each addressing a specific aspect of functional safety in the automotive industry. Here is a brief description of each part:

1. Part 1: Vocabulary: This part provides a comprehensive set of terms and definitions used in ISO 26262. It ensures consistent understanding and communication of safety concepts and requirements among stakeholders.
2. Part 2: Management of Functional Safety: Part 2 focuses on the management aspects of functional safety. It provides guidelines for establishing a safety management system, defining safety goals and requirements, and allocating safety responsibilities within the organization.
3. Part 3: Concept Phase: This part deals with the early concept phase of the safety lifecycle. It covers hazard analysis and risk assessment techniques, identification of safety goals, and development of a safety concept for the system.
4. Part 4: System Level: Part 4 focuses on the development of the safety-related system at the system level. It includes topics such as system architecture, safety requirements, hardware and software design, and integration of system components.
5. Part 5: Product Development at the Hardware Level: This part specifically addresses the development of safety-related hardware components. It covers aspects like hardware design, verification, and validation, including techniques for testing and fault tolerance.
6. Part 6: Product Development at the Software Level: Part 6 focuses on the development of safety-related software components. It provides guidance on software development processes, software requirements, verification and validation, and software unit testing.
7. Part 7: Production, Operation, Service, and Decommissioning: This part deals with activities related to the production, operation, servicing, and decommissioning of the safety-related system. It covers manufacturing processes, installation, commissioning, maintenance, and end-of-life considerations.
8. Part 8: Supporting Processes: Part 8 addresses various supporting processes essential for functional safety. It includes topics such as configuration management, change management, verification and validation, and documentation requirements.
9. Part 9: Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL)-oriented and Safety-Oriented Analysis: This part provides detailed guidance on performing safety-oriented analyses based on the ASIL. It covers techniques such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Dependent Failure Analysis (DFA).
10. Part 10: Guideline on ISO 26262: This part provides additional guidance and examples to support the application of ISO 26262. It offers practical insights and recommendations for implementing the standard's requirements effectively.
11. Part 11: Guideline on Application of Clauses 5 to 10 of ISO 26262: This part focuses on the application of specific clauses from Parts 5 to 10 of ISO 26262. It provides detailed explanations, examples, and interpretations of the requirements in those sections.
12. Part 12: Adaptation of ISO 26262 for motorcycles: This part specifically addresses the adaptation of ISO 26262 for the development of safety-related systems in motorcycles. It takes into account the unique characteristics and requirements of motorcycles.
